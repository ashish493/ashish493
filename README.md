### Hey there! :wave:

-  I'm an AI & Security enthusiast passionate about building secure, intelligent systems.
-  Built real-time ML/DL systems: Siamese network for face recognition, CNN for handwriting, and diffusion-based image generation.
-  Worked on NLP tools using `NLTK`, `TF-IDF`, and developer knowledge graphs.
-  Integrated ML models into production via Django REST APIs and containerized deployments.
-  Earlier I actively contributed to Sig-Security subgroup of Kubernetes to the [Kubernetes Hardening Guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-security/issues/30) for which I was nominated for the 2023 Kubernetes Contributor [Awards](https://www.kubernetes.dev/community/awards/2023/#security). 
-  In free time, I travel, listen to rock Music or explore war history.
