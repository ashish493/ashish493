### Hey there! :wave:

-  I'm a security enthusiast currently exploring the field of cloud native. 
-  At present, I'm active in the [Sig-Security](https://www.kubernetes.dev/community/awards/2023/#security) subgroup of Kubernetes and contributing to the [Kubernetes Hardening Guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-security/issues/30). 
-  I mostly write in Go now, but earlier I used Python heavily.
-  I also play CTFs occasionally, which are focused on challenges related to Kubernetes. I recently participated in the challenges of [EKS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OFclp4zO6nvxSbroNNlknu2wz_BsmP8A/view) and [Amazon IAM](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OjTWO4kkx4pq-VlprVgu34-5uNKUohim/view).  
-  In free time, I travel, listen to rock Music or explore war history.
-  You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ashishm47) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashishmalik47/).
